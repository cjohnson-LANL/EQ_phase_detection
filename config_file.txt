Model files for processing seismic waveforms
using TF_EncDecDet.py

Two models are required:
P_S Encoder-Decoder : Eq; P & S Wave phase arrival 
P_FM                : P-Wave first motion arrival

Each model requires:
Model type with sps: [phase_detection_100] & [p_fm_100]
directory path
sample rate of training waveforms (must be equal for all models)

duration - training length in seconds (unet models must be equal)
trained model (.tf)


Only change the variable assigment. Keep names and format as is!
